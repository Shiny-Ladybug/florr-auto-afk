extensions.port=Websocket server port
extensions.defaultRoute=Default Websocket Route for extensions
extensions.swapInterval=How often to swap the file I/O
extensions.bgRemove=Turn the AFK Check background to solid black when AFK detected, this will help the model to detect AFK more accurately
extensions.uploadPath=(Not Implemented)
extensions.autoChat=Chat with other players automatically
extensions.autoChat.enable=Enable
extensions.autoChat.selfUsername=Your own username(ID), or the model will respond to your own messages
extensions.autoChat.chatType=Ollama or OpenAI uses models to generate responses, Random uses a list of random responses. Ollama end point is `/api/chat` while OpenAI end point is `/v1/chat/completions`. Keep alive only works for Ollama.

extensions.autoChat.chatAPIKey=Your own API Key when using OpenAI API
extensions.autoChat.chatModel=Chat Model
extensions.autoChat.chatKeepAlive=If you are using local ollama mode, set this to `0` to keep the model alive, otherwise set it to `-1` to disable. Only works for Ollama.
extensions.autoChat.historyMaxLength=Chat History Max Length
extensions.autoChat.chatEnableThink=Enable Thinking. Only works for Qwen3 models.
extensions.autoChat.chatWhitelist=Chat Whitelist, leave it `[]` to disable

extensions.autoChat.chatMaxDistance=Chat Max Distance, set to `null` to disable
extensions.autoChat.enableFullControl=Allow the LLM to control your actions (move `goto someone`, equip `petal`) besides chatting, suggest using `DeepSeek-R1 (Quantization instead of Distilled version)`, `Qwen3:8b+`, `Qwen2.5`, `o1`, `4o`, `Gemini-2.0`, `Gemini-2.5 Pro`
extensions.autoChat.fullControl=Full Control Configurations
extensions.autoChat.fullControl.followDuration=How long to follow the target, set to `0` to disable
extensions.autoChat.fullControl.steps=How many steps to move, set to `0` to disable
extensions.autoChat.chatRandomResponses=Chat Random Responses Lists
extensions.autoCalibrate=Auto calibrate yourself to the middle of your squad members
advanced.saveTrainData=Save trainable dataset for semi-supervised learning at `./train`, decide whether you want to upload those data to the developer for improving the model
advanced.moveMouse=Move Mouse
advanced.useOBS=Set OBS start hotkey to `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O` and stop hotkey to `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P`, then you can use OBS to record the screen, and the program will automatically start/stop recording when AFK detected/bypassed
advanced.verbose=Verbose
advanced.epochInterval=Sleep time between detection periods, reduce this value if you have anxiety disorders
advanced.optimizeQuantization=Auto Jump some points to speed up the detection, but it may cause imprecise detection
advanced.rdpEpsilon=Reduce this value to make the mouse move more smooth, but it will take more time to calculate and execute
advanced.saveImage=Save AFK Image
advanced.saveYOLOImage=Save YOLO Detect and Segmentation Image
advanced.extendLength=Extend the path to make sure you reach the end
advanced.mouseSpeed=Mouse Speed
advanced.skipUpdate=Skip Update
advanced.environment=Just to record if you have tested your environment

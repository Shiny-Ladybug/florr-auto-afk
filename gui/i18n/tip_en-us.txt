runs=Runs Configurations
exposure=Exposure Configurations
gui=GUI (affect after restart)
advanced=Advanced Settings
executeBinary=Excute Binaries after AFK Detected / after AFK Bypassed
yoloConfig=YOLO Config
runs.autoTakeOverWhenIdle=When user is idle for `runs.idleTimeThreshold` seconds, program will do the AFK for you
runs.runningCountDown=Close the program after `x` minutes, set to `-1` for infinite
runs.moveAfterAFK=Do little move `wasd` after AFK bypassed to prevent `Moving Checks`
runs.idleTimeThreshold=Idle Time Threshold
runs.idleDetInterval=Idle Detection Interval
runs.idleDetIntervalMax=Idle Detection Max Interval
runs.notify=Send Notification when AFK detected
runs.sound=Play Spooky Sound when AFK detected
runs.soundPath=Sound Path
exposure.enable=Enable Exposure
exposure.moveInterval=Move left and right to eliminate background interference during exposure, set this value to `0` to disable this feature
exposure.duration=Exposure Duration
gui.language=Only for `zh-cn` and `en-us`
gui.theme=Only for `dark`, `light` and `auto`
advanced.saveTrainData=Save trainable dataset for semi-supervised learning at `./train`, decide whether you want to upload those data to the developer for improving the model
advanced.moveMouse=Move Mouse
advanced.useOBS=Set OBS start hotkey to `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O` and stop hotkey to `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P`, then you can use OBS to record the screen, and the program will automatically start/stop recording when AFK detected/bypassed
advanced.verbose=Verbose
advanced.epochInterval=Sleep time between detection periods, reduce this value if you have anxiety disorders
advanced.optimizeQuantization=Auto Jump some points to speed up the detection, but it may cause imprecise detection
advanced.rdpEpsilon=Reduce this value to make the mouse move more smooth, but it will take more time to calculate and execute
advanced.saveImage=Save AFK Image
advanced.saveYOLOImage=Save YOLO Detect and Segmentation Image
advanced.extendLength=Extend the path to make sure you reach the end
advanced.mouseSpeed=Mouse Speed
advanced.skipUpdate=Skip Update
advanced.environment=Just to record if you have tested your environment
advanced.debug=If you run into any issues, try turn on this and send `debug.log` and `latest.log` to the developer
advanced.windowSizeTolerance=The tolerance of the window size
advanced.windowSizeRatio=The ratio of AFK window size to prevent detecting other similar windows (Note: You'd better not open the `可爱猫娘`'s `super ping` when using the program, otherwise your images folder will be filled with sping window screenshots)
executeBinary.runBeforeAFK=Before
executeBinary.runAfterAFK=After
yoloConfig.segModel=Segmentation Model Path
yoloConfig.detModel=Detect Model Path
